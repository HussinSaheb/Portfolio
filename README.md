### Changes
I have decided to move the the small upwards chevron from the desktop version and only make it visible for mobile version of the portfolio.

The right panel in the "About me" section is now being used to show a portrait image of myself in the desktop. Whereas, the mobile version has the portrait being centred and at the top.
